&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="/project/geoscienceterminology/">Geoscience Terminology Working Group&lt;/a>, in collaboration with the
&lt;a href="/project/earthresourceml/">EarthResourceML Working Group&lt;/a> recently approved the adoption of 18 new vocabularies to support delivery of mineral occurrence and mine data using the EarthResourceML data transfer standard. The vocabularies have been developed in collaboration with the European Union’s Minerals Intelligence Network for Europe (Minerals4EU), so that Minerals4EU vocabularies use either exactly the same terms or have mappings to CGI terminology. The vocabularies are to be published soon through the
&lt;a href="http://resource.geosciml.org" title="http://resource.geosciml.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CGI&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary service&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="3d-geological-data-models--a-call-for-participants-in-a-review-of-3d-standards">3D Geological Data Models — a call for participants in a review of 3D standards&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="/img/3d.jpg" title="3D geological data model">&lt;img src="/img/3d.jpg" alt="3D geological data model">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By nature, geological information is 3D (or even 4D). To date, CGI efforts to support geological data interoperability have focused on exchange of geological map and borehole information with GeoSciML and EarthResourceML, using GML as the underlying spatial data engine. With the growing demand for exchanging 3D geological models in many domains (eg, oil and gas, mining, groundwater, design of infrastructure), there is a clear need for standardizing the exchange of 3D models independently of the data format used by the modeling software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is currently no accepted generic exchange model for 3D geological models, although there have been some attempts in different organizations or projects. The CGI Council considers it a priority for the Commission to&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>review the current situation in the delivery of 3D geological models, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>propose a strategy for identifying or developing an agreed standard possibly in partnership with other standardization bodies.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We are now calling for volunteers to participate in an ad-hoc group to be setup in CGI on this topic. If you are interested, please email the CGI Chair,

&lt;p>The joint OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group (SWG) has recently held two teleconference meetings – one of them as part of the quarterly OGC Technical Committee meeting in Washington DC. Steve Richard provided a summary of his recent work to document the use cases needed for development of the GeoSciML version 4 standard. The working group will gather together in Tucson, USA from June 29 to July 3 for its annual face-to-face meeting. This will be held in conjunction with similar meetings of the EarthResourceML and Geoscience Terminology working groups, and the OneGeology Technical working group.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="http://www.geosciml.org/news_20142904_geoserver_cookbook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new user guide for GeoSciML data providers&lt;/a> has also just been published by the

&lt;p>A 1:1 million scale geological map of China has recently been released by the China Geological Survey as a contribution of China to the
&lt;a href="http://www.onegeology.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneGeology initiative&lt;/a>. The 1:1M geological map data cover most of the land areas of China and is now available as a OGC Web Map Service (WMS). Map layers include bedrock lithology, lithostratigraphy and major faults.

&lt;p>The 25th Colloquium of African Geology will be held in conjunction with the 3rd Congress of the Young Earth Scientists network (YES) in August 2014, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. During the conference, the GIRAF Network and the Southern and Eastern African Mineral Centre (SEAMIC), is organising a session on geoscience information in Africa. Other conference participants are expected to include the Geological Society of Africa (GSAf), The African Association of Women Geologists (AAWG), OneGeology, AEGOS, and UNECA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The geoscience information session will include presentations and discussions on the building of spatial data infrastructure in Africa, regional geoinformation initiatives; interoperability and standards; and best practices in delivery, dissemination and exploitation of geoscience information. Participants are encouraged to submit abstracts on their solutions and experiences of managing and delivering geoscience information to underpin public policy-making, investment, research and education.

&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="http://foss4g-e.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOSS4G PDX 2014&lt;/a> conference will be held in Portland, Oregon, USA from 8–13 September. The annual FOSS4G conference is the largest global gathering focused on open source geospatial software. FOSS4G brings together developers, users, decision-makers and observers from a broad spectrum of organizations and fields of operation. Through six days of workshops, presentations, discussions, and cooperation, FOSS4G participants create effective and relevant geospatial products, standards, and protocols.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CGI hopes to sponsor a competition at this conference for developers to design and build an application that displays innovative use of interoperable geoscience data, such as web map and web feature services and standard geoscience vocabularies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At the recent CGI Council meeting in November in Denver, USA, the long-running Interoperability Working Group (IWG) headed by John Laxton from the British Geological Survey, was dissolved. However, that does not mean the work of John and the IWG members is over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The IWG&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="http://www.geosciml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeoSciML&lt;/a> Task Group became a Standards Working Group of the
&lt;a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Geospatial Consortium&lt;/a> in January 2013, chaired by
&lt;a href="mailto:oliver.raymond@ga.gov.au">Ollie Raymond&lt;/a> of Geoscience Australia. Future development and documentation of GeoSciML will be done under a collaborative arrangement between OGC and CGI.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Version 2.0 of the CGI data standard for mineral occurrences and mines has been published.
&lt;a href="http://schemas.earthresourceml.org/2.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XML schemas&lt;/a> and

&lt;a href="https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/CGIModel/EarthResourceML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ERML Working Group&lt;/a>. ERML is now fully compatible with the requirements of the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INSPIRE data specification&lt;/a> for Mineral Resources. Geological Surveys in
&lt;a href="http://www.geoscience.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australia and New Zealand&lt;/a> have also endorsed the ERML standard for delivery of mineral occurrence data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Version 2 of the GeoSciML-Portrayal simple features WFS data standard was released in August. The
&lt;a href="http://schemas.geosciml.org/geosciml-portrayal/2.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schema&lt;/a> provides a simple attribute structure for digital map portrayal of geologic units, faults, contacts, and now borehole collar locations. GeoSciML-Portrayal is also recommended for use as an attribute standard for WMS web services. The data standard is endorsed by several international data sharing initiatives, including
&lt;a href="http://www.onegeology.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneGeology&lt;/a> and the
