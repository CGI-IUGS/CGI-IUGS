&lt;p>A CGI council member&amp;rsquo;s term is 4 years, starting and ending at the CGI General Assembly at International Geological Congress. The process for application and election of CGI Councillors starts several months in advance of the CGI General Assembly and is described below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-application-process">The Application Process&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="call-for-applications">Call for Applications&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Applications for Council will be received for a period of 1 month after the call for applications which will be posted on the CGI web site and circulated to CGI members by email.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="application-requirements">Application Requirements&lt;/h4>

&lt;h4 id="review-of-applicants-by-cgi-council">Review of Applicants by CGI Council&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The CGI Council will review the applications based on the criteria outlined above and select a maximum of 30 applicants to stand for election for the 12 possible Council positions. A principal objective of the selection process will be to identify a group of applicants with diverse and complementary expertise and regional affiliation. In the case of Council members standing for re-election, their contribution and meeting attendance during the current term will be amongst the factors considered.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-election-process">The Election Process&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>CGI members will be emailed by the Secretary General voting instructions and a list of candidates and asked to vote for a maximum of 12 councillors. Four weeks will be allowed for voting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Approximately 2 months before the annual General Assembly at the International Geological Congress, the identity of all selected candidates will be put on the CGI Website accompanied by a brief description of their background and skills. New CGI members who join CGI after this date will not be permitted to participate in this election process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At the end of the voting period, the CGI Council will compile the votes and identify the successful candidates. To fill the geographical requirement and ensure that all regions of the world are represented, a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 4 candidates, will be selected from each of the 5 identified geographic regions of the globe. This will be achieved by choosing an initial candidate with the most votes for every one of the 5 regions, then the other candidates will be selected according to the number of votes they have obtained, with a limit of 4 per region.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The successful candidates will be contacted by email to request that they confirm in writing that they will have support of their agencies to participate in CGI Council activities and attend annual CGI Council meetings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upon receipt of confirmation of support, the new Council will be announced to CGI members and the IUGS Secretariat by email; and also posted on the CGI website approximately 2 months in advance of the IGC.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="selection-of-the-cgi-council-chair-secretary-general-and-treasurer">Selection of the CGI Council Chair, Secretary General, and Treasurer.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The new Council will meet and take over from the old Council at the IGC and agree who will take on the specific roles of CGI Council Chair, Secretary General, and Treasurer. The result will be announced to CGI members and the IUGS Secretariat by email; and also posted on the CGI website.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
