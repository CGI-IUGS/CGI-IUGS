&lt;h2 id="a-busy-time-for-cgi">A Busy Time for CGI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>May and June was a busy time for many CGI members. Three of CGI&amp;rsquo;s standards working groups, the CGI Council, the OneGeology Technical Implementation Group, and the 32nd annual Geoscience Information Consortium (GIC) conference all met over a period of two weeks in Vienna, Austria and Orleans, France.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geosciml-standards-working-group">GeoSciML Standards Working Group&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/geosciml.jpg" alt="GeoSciML logo">&lt;br>
&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/ogc_logo.jpg" alt="OGC logo">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group (SWG) held its
&lt;a href="http://external.opengeospatial.org/twiki_public/GeoSciMLswg/ViennaFace2FaceJune2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual face-to-face meeting&lt;/a> at Geologische Bundesanstalt (Geological Survey of Austria) in Vienna in May. This was the first meeting since the GeoSciML v4.1 data standard was ratified and
&lt;a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/2563" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by OGC&lt;/a> in March. All current documentation and schemas are now hosted on the
&lt;a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosciml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OGC website&lt;/a>. The original
&lt;a href="http://www.geosciml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CGI website&lt;/a> still maintains access to all historic versions of GeoSciML and links to other supporting resources like UML models and
&lt;a href="http://resource.geosciml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vocabularies&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/Eric_boisvert.jpg" alt="Eric Boisvert">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 8 years as Chair of the Working Group, Ollie Raymond stepped down and Eric Boisvert (pictured) from the Geological Survey of Canada has taken on the role. We wish Eric and the team every success as the SWG enters a new phase in GeoSciML development. The working group discussed minor corrections to the version 4.1 standard, considered a GML version 3.2 profile of GeoSciML-Lite, and reviewed the best practice of delivering data using the GeoSciML-Lite data standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Members also considered the future direction of the SWG, in particular towards potential new standard encodings of the GeoSciML data model, such as RDF and JSON.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="towards-a-new-version-of-erml">Towards a New Version of ERML&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/working_group_BRGM_cropped.jpg" alt="EarthResourceML (ERML) Working Group">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The annual EarthResourceML (ERML) Working Group meeting was held in June in Orleans, France, hosted by BRGM. CGI members from France, Finland, Australia and New Zealand attended the one day meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The working group discussed a proposal from Geoscience Australia for a modification to way that the ERML-Lite data standard delivers commodity resource and reserve amounts. This request was based on the Australian and New Zealand experience of recently establishing the world&amp;rsquo;s first
&lt;a href="http://services.ga.gov.au/earthresource/ows?service=wfs&amp;amp;version=1.1.0&amp;amp;request=GetCapabilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ERML-Lite WFS services&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EU-funded
&lt;a href="http://www.prosumproject.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProSum project&lt;/a> also presented a proposal to extend the ERML full model. The proposal will add Processing Activity and Processing Plant to the model. Other technical changes, including links to GeoSciML v4 and implementing recent GeoSciML modelling patterns, will be added to the EarthResourceML and after a review and voting period, a new version ERML v 3.0 will be published later in 2017.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/erml-logo.jpg" alt="ERML logo">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CGI intends to have a strong presence at the
&lt;a href="http://rfg2018.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFG2018 conference&lt;/a> in Vancouver in June 2018, in particular to promote ERML and ERML-Lite to North America. New ERML and ERML-Lite implementations and use cases will be demonstrated there. Documentation and schemas for EarthResourceML v2.0 and EarthResourceML-Lite v1.0 are available on the
&lt;a href="http://www.earthresourceml.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.earthresourceml.org&lt;/a> website.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geoscience-vocabularies">Geoscience Vocabularies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG) met for its fourth face-to-face meeting at the Geological Survey of Austria in Vienna on May 26. Twenty-two people participated in person or remotely. Several key vocabularies that are in advanced stages of preparation have been prioritised for completion, notably the Natural Geomorphologic Feature, Mineral Deposit Type and Regional Lithological Unit Synthesis vocabularies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A presentation by Chris Schubert from the Austrian Climate Change Centre outlined development on federated registries of vocabularies in Europe, and has helped confirm that GTWG’s role in providing globally-relevant geoscience terms that can work in parallel with geological surveys’ more local vocabulary requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/sissvoc/cgi201211/collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CGI Vocabulary Service&lt;/a>, hosted by Australia’s CSIRO for around a decade, is in the process of being moved to its new hosting organisation, Geoscience Australia. As part of the move to new hosting arrangements, all 2016 editions of CGI&amp;rsquo;s vocabularies are also incorporated in the

&lt;h3 id="ccop-workshop-on-igdp-and-compilation-technology">CCOP Workshop on IGDP and Compilation Technology&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A cooperation project between China and the Southeast Asia Geoscience Program Coordinating Committee (CCOP) on Integrated Geological Data Processing (IGDP) was kicked off at a workshop hosted by the China Geological Survey (CGS) on 22–24 May in Beijing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/CCOP_workshop_2017.jpg" alt="CCOP Workshop on IGDP and Compilation Technology">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The workshop included training for CCOP member countries on data processing techniques for geological, geophysical and geochemical data. Twenty participants from Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam and the CCOP Technical Secretariat joined a discussion on OneGeology geological map data delivery technologies, and regional geoscience map compilation techniques. A work plan for the next two years was prepared.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="information-sharing-for-the-belt-and-route-region">Information Sharing for the &amp;lsquo;Belt and Route Region&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A seminar was held at the China Geological Survey in Beijing on 16–20 May, 2017, aimed at geoscience information sharing amongst the vast region of the so-called the &amp;lsquo;Belt and Route Region&amp;rsquo;. The region, coined by the Chinese government, covers part or all of Oceania, Asia, Europe, Arab and Africa. More than 50 officials and experts from different geological organisations exchanged views and shared current technology for data exchange and information sharing. CGI-IUGS standards and the CCOP metadata standard will be used for data transfer once the cooperation project application is approved by the Chinese government.&lt;/p>

The seminar was organised under the auspices of the Ibero-American States Organizations, Portugal, Uruguay, and the Argentina Ministry of Science and Technology. Science, technology and innovation agencies from Spain, Brasil and Colombia also participated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The seminar discussed &amp;lsquo;Open Science&amp;rsquo; to enable collaborative research and knowledge distribution by digital means. In particular, the regional science community see it as a way to improve science and technology development and performance in South America.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/Sth_America_news_2017.jpg" alt="Ibero-American Open Science Meeting in Buenos Aires">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The meeting was focused mainly on open digital repositories. In this context, not only will written publications be reviewed, but also their supporting data and results. It is hoped that in the future this initial step by Latin American countries will facilitate the access to and development of interoperable data and methods for any kind of scientific data. The regional science community intends to facilitiate the development of initiatives currently occurring at different levels and domains in international organisations like IUGS CGI,
&lt;a href="https://www.icsu-wds.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICSU&lt;/a>, and the
&lt;a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research Data Alliance&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/NZ_map.jpg" alt="Geological map of New Zealand">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GNS Science, the New Zealand government geoscience agency, is just one example of a data provider embracing CGI data standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As mentioned in the EarthResourceML news above, an EarthResourceML-Lite-compliant web service of New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s mineral occurrences is available (see
&lt;a href="http://maps.gns.cri.nz/geoserver/web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gns:GERM_ERML_VIEW&lt;/a>). Two New Zealand geological map datasets — the 1:1M Geological map of New Zealand and the 1:250k Geological Map of Southern Victoria Land (Antarctica) — are now available as GeoSciML Lite-compliant web services, have been accredited with 4-star OneGeology status, and can be accessed from the
&lt;a href="http://maps.gns.cri.nz/geology/web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNS web service interface&lt;/a>. The layers include links to CGI codelists for age terms, unit types, representative lithology and metadata records.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2017 version of the
&lt;a href="https://www.gns.cri.nz/Home/Our-Science/Earth-Science/Regional-Geology/Geological-Maps/1-250-000-Geological-Map-of-New-Zealand-QMAP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QMAP 1:250 000 Geological Map&lt;/a> of New Zealand seamless GIS dataset contains links to CGI code-lists for age terms, unit types, representative lithology and metadata records amongst others. New Zealand’s Petlab Geoanalytical Database of rock and mineral properties has also incorporated CGI vocabulary terms for rock names and geological age.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cgi-council-news">CGI Council News&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The CGI Council held its 2017 annual meeting in Vienna in June.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/CGI_Council_cropped.jpg" alt="CGI Council">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The councillors addressed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>activities for CGI funding in 2017–18&lt;/li>
&lt;li>planning for the RFG 2018 conference in Vancouver next year&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a proposal for the coordination of hydrogeology data standards development in CGI and OGC&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the need to recruit and rejuvenate active membership in CGI working groups&lt;/li>
&lt;li>better promotion of CGI activities and standards&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="32nd-annual-gic-conference">32nd Annual GIC Conference&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/32_GIC_1.jpg" alt="32nd Annual GIC Conference">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="http://www.g-i-c.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoscience Information Consortium&lt;/a> (GIC) is an annual gathering of information managers from international government Geological Survey agencies. The 32nd GIC Conference was held from May 29 to June 3 at the Geological Survey of Austria (GBA) in Vienna. Many CGI members attended, and shared their work with Geological Survey representatives from 35 countries from every continent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conference heard a wide range of presentations on current best practice in data management and data delivery from many individual Geological Surveys, as well as collaborative data sharing initiatives from around the world. Panel discussion sessions also shared the experiences and requirements of the Geological Surveys in managing and delivering 3D geological models, future data management strategies, and emerging technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/images/newsletters/32_GIC_2.jpg" alt="32nd Annual GIC Conference">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Government Geological Survey information managers are encouraged to join the 33rd annual GIC conference which will be hosted by Geoscience Australia in Canberra, Australia in mid 2018.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>CGI cordially invites its members to the
&lt;a href="http://rfg2018.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFG 2018&lt;/a> conference in Vancouver, Canada, 16–21 June 2018. IUGS is a partner organisation at this conference and CGI encourages all its members to at the conference to demonstrate how CGI&amp;rsquo;s standards and best practice in data delivery and analysis supports and enables sustainable resource discovery and exploitation. It is anticipated that the use of web service data delivery, in particular using the EarthResourceML and EarthResourceML-Lite data transfer standards, will be a feature. The conference will be a forum for industry stakeholders to discuss their research initiatives and activities as well as the key issues and trends shaping the future of energy, minerals and water resources.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://www.epos-ip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Plate Observing System&lt;/a> (EPOS) is a long-term plan to facilitate integrated use of data and facilities from distributed research infrastructures for solid Earth science. It aims to establish a comprehensive multidisciplinary research platform for the Earth sciences in Europe. EPOS aims to facilitiate the integration of a wide range of heterogeneous data and services, including seismology, volcanology, geology and surface dynamics, geodesy, geomagnetism, analytical and experimental laboratory research, rock physics and petrology, and satellite information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/epos.jpg" alt="EPOS">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>European CGI members are engaged in EPOS workshops and hackathons with a view to having an operational infrastructure by 2020. IUGS and CGI data standards will no doubt play a large role in enabling data transfer to and from EPOS researchers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
&lt;a href="http://www.geosciml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/geosciml.jpg" alt="GeoSciML logo">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="http://www.geosciml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeoSciML&lt;/a> data transfer standard was recently accepted by a unanimous vote of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Technical Committee. This significant milestone cements GeoSciML&amp;rsquo;s place as the international geological data transfer standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Documentation and schemas for GeoSciML version 4.1 will be available on the OGC and &lt;a href="http://www.geosciml.org">www.geosciml.org&lt;/a> websites early in 2017. Due to some changes required by the OGC review process, GeoSciML will move from version 4.0 to version 4.1. The most significant change in version 4.1 is the renaming of &lt;strong>GeoSciML-Portrayal&lt;/strong> to &lt;strong>GeoSciML-Lite&lt;/strong> to avoid confusion with use of the word &amp;lsquo;portrayal&amp;rsquo; in other standards domains. The only other changes from version 4.0 to 4.1 are minor bug fixes and improvements to documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/ogc_logo.jpg" alt="OGC logo">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The considerable documentation required for OGC accreditation was compiled by Eric Boisvert of the Geological Survey of Canada, with assistance from Ollie Raymond (Geoscience Australia) and Marcus Sen (British Geological Survey). Many thanks for a great effort!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="earthresourceml-lite">EarthResourceML-Lite&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A new abridged, simple feature (WFS SF-0) version of the
&lt;a href="http://www.earthresourceml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EarthResourceML&lt;/a> data model was released by CGI in August 2016. EarthResourceML-Lite (or ERML-Lite) can be used to deliver simplified views on mineral occurrences and their commodities, mines, mining activities and mine waste products.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/erml-logo.jpg" alt="ERML logo">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ERML-Lite has a similar purpose to GeoSciML-Lite, in that it enables delivery of a simplified view of the full EarthResourceML model which can be used for exchange of data in simple formats that can be easily rendered in GIS applications and web mapping portals (e.g., WMS, simple WFS, shapefiles, CSV tables).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Steve was a research geologist and Head of Geoinformatics at the Arizona Geological Survey from 1992 until 2016, but his influence on North American and international geoinformatics extends way beyond the borders of Arizona. Steve was a leading member of the North American Geological Map Data Model (NADM) Steering Committee from 2000 to 2007. He worked with this consortium of American and Canadian geoscientists, database designers, and developers of geologic map information to develop a comprehensive geological data model that would form one of the foundations for global standards development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steve was a founding member of the CGI Interoperability Working Group in 2004. As part of this group, Steve was a leading force for over 10 years in the development of the GeoSciML standard for geoscience data transfer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steve has also been deeply involved in development of international geoscience vocabularies through the IUGS CGI Controlled Vocabularies Working Group, and was the founding Chair of the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Over 30 internationally-agreed vocabularies were published under Steve&amp;rsquo;s leadership.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steve has also been a leader in technical development of the US Geoscience Information Network (USGIN) - especially as chief architect of the US National Geothermal Data System - to deploy web services for geoscience information exchange. His advocacy of OGC and CGI standards in US geological surveys has led to these global standards being embedded in North American data delivery best practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geoscience-vocabularies">Geoscience Vocabularies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG) has been working away compiling key vocabularies to support the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML geoscience data models. The
&lt;a href="http://resource.geosciml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CGI vocabulary service&lt;/a> has been hosted by CSIRO in Australia from its inception, but is soon to be migrated onto a server hosted by Geoscience Australia. The GTWG is very appreciative of the efforts of CSIRO in developing and maintaining the vocabulary service for over a decade and thanks Geoscience Australia for agreeing to support the service into the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The important
&lt;a href="http://resource.geosciml.org/static/vocabulary/earthresourceml/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commodity Code vocabulary&lt;/a> was compiled and adopted in 2015; a highly hierarchically organised vocabulary of 291 terms describing natural and processed earth resource commodities. This vocabulary is showcased in the
&lt;a href="http://minerals4eu.brgm-rec.fr/minerals4EU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minerals4EU Map Viewer&lt;/a> web application for mineral commodities around Europe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/minerals4EU.jpg" alt="Minerals4EU Map Viewer">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EarthResourceML vocabularies have been translated into 22 other European languages through the INSPIRE directive and these multi-lingual vocabularies will be adapted for delivery through the CGI vocabulary service. Many more vocabularies are still required, particularly for the Extension schema of the GeoSciML model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Working Group is always looking for more active members to contribute to compilation of geoscience vocabularies, particularly in languages other than English. Contact the group&amp;rsquo;s chair, compose(&amp;lsquo;M.Rattenbury&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;gns&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;cri.nz&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Mark Rattenbury&amp;rsquo;);, if you would like to contribute to the work.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="cgi-members-honoured">CGI Members Honoured&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Three members of CGI have recently been honoured with awards from international information management and data standards organisations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/XiaogangMa.jpg" alt="Dr Xiaogang (Marshall) Ma">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Dr Xiaogang (Marshall) Ma&lt;/strong> was awarded the
&lt;a href="https://www.icsu-wds.org/news/news-archive/wds-stewardship-award-201320132014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Data System (WDS-ICSU) Data Stewardship Award&lt;/a> for 2014 at the SciDataCon 2014 Conference in New Delhi. The award highlights exceptional contributions to the improvement of scientific data stewardship by early career researchers through their engagement with the community, academic achievements, and innovations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marshall is a geoinformatics and data science researcher with extensive research in geoscience ontologies, and has worked recently on the capture and representation of data provenance in scientific workflows. Marshall is a member of the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group, the International Association for Mathematical Geosciences (IAMG; founder and first president of IAMG&amp;rsquo;s student chapter in 2010), the American Geophysical Union, and the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners. Marshall was coordinator for the GeoData 2014 workshop (highlighting inter-agency data networks in the US), and the 2014 Deep Carbon Observatory Data Science Day symposium, and organizer of a data provenance session for the Association of American Geographers 2014 Annual Meeting.

&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/peterBaumann.jpg" alt="Dr Peter Baumann">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Dr Peter Baumann&lt;/strong>, Professor of Computer Science at Jacobs University and a current CGI council member, was awarded the
&lt;a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/awards/gardels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kenneth D. Gardels Award by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)&lt;/a> for 2014. The award is in recognition of his &amp;ldquo;significant contribution to the OGC&amp;rsquo;s essential role and mission in the global Information Technology community&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jeffrey K. Harris, Chairman of the OGC Board of Directors, said: &amp;ldquo;We wish to express our deep appreciation for the extraordinary contribution you have made to the OGC community and to people around the world who are the ultimate beneficiaries of improvements in the development, management and use of geoscientific data. Devoting your time and bringing your dedication, expertise, critical thinking and leadership to OGC working groups has resulted in significant and enduring advances in technical standards. The value you&amp;rsquo;ve createdhas been leveraged, and the OGC&amp;rsquo;s work overall has been leveraged, through your active participation in other standards bodies, expert groups, councils and commissions. We thank you for this collaborative work, for it benefits us all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Peter is editor of twelve adopted standards related to the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) suite of Big Geo Data standards. Recently he has been instrumental in establishing a new Big Data Domain Working Group within the OGC which he also co-chairs. Peter&amp;rsquo;s research focuses on large-scale scientific information services, in particular: massive multi-dimensional data cubes. He has architected the
&lt;a href="http://www.rasdaman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rasdaman&lt;/a> (&amp;ldquo;raster data manager&amp;rdquo;) technology which has pioneered a new research field, Array Databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/img/ianJackson.jpg" alt="Ian Jackson">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Geological Society of America honoured &lt;strong>Ian Jackson&lt;/strong> with their
&lt;a href="http://www.geosociety.org/awards/14speeches/geoinfo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outstanding Contributions in Geoinformatics award&lt;/a> for 2014. The award recognises an individual who has contributed in an outstanding manner to geology through the application of the principles of geoinformatics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ian was a councillor of CGI from 2004 to 2012. Ian understood the importance of standards to achieve the opening of geoscientific data for diverse uses, and took a decisive part in the recreation of the IUGS-CGI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The award citation notes Ian&amp;rsquo;s long and superb service to advance the field of geoinformatics through his pioneering work at the British Geological Survey, to the establishment and unprecedented success of the OneGeology initiative. A dominant theme throughout Ian&amp;rsquo;s career has been the wide application of geoscience data for societal benefit, a goal he continues to promote as a consultant on the international stage. Ian has been one of the first in geological survey organizations worldwide to understand, and more importantly, to change the organization of the survey to fulfill its role of &amp;ldquo;information agency.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among his many accomplishments, Ian is perhaps best known as the primary instigator of OneGeology - a global initiative to make digital geological map data accessible throughout the world. Ian&amp;rsquo;s colleagues uniformly refer to his ability to inspire others on the OneGeology concept and build a strong team with the skills to create OneGeology, his keen awareness of how to get things done, and his ability to find constructive ways around obstacles as key to the success of the initiative.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/project/geoscienceterminology/">Geoscience Terminology Working Group&lt;/a>, in collaboration with the
&lt;a href="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/project/earthresourceml/">EarthResourceML Working Group&lt;/a> recently approved the adoption of 18 new vocabularies to support delivery of mineral occurrence and mine data using the EarthResourceML data transfer standard. The vocabularies have been developed in collaboration with the European Union’s Minerals Intelligence Network for Europe (Minerals4EU), so that Minerals4EU vocabularies use either exactly the same terms or have mappings to CGI terminology. The vocabularies are to be published soon through the
&lt;a href="http://resource.geosciml.org" title="http://resource.geosciml.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CGI&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary service&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By nature, geological information is 3D (or even 4D). To date, CGI efforts to support geological data interoperability have focused on exchange of geological map and borehole information with GeoSciML and EarthResourceML, using GML as the underlying spatial data engine. With the growing demand for exchanging 3D geological models in many domains (eg, oil and gas, mining, groundwater, design of infrastructure), there is a clear need for standardizing the exchange of 3D models independently of the data format used by the modeling software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is currently no accepted generic exchange model for 3D geological models, although there have been some attempts in different organizations or projects. The CGI Council considers it a priority for the Commission to&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>review the current situation in the delivery of 3D geological models, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>propose a strategy for identifying or developing an agreed standard possibly in partnership with other standardization bodies.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We are now calling for volunteers to participate in an ad-hoc group to be setup in CGI on this topic. If you are interested, please email the CGI Chair,

&lt;p>The joint OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group (SWG) has recently held two teleconference meetings – one of them as part of the quarterly OGC Technical Committee meeting in Washington DC. Steve Richard provided a summary of his recent work to document the use cases needed for development of the GeoSciML version 4 standard. The working group will gather together in Tucson, USA from June 29 to July 3 for its annual face-to-face meeting. This will be held in conjunction with similar meetings of the EarthResourceML and Geoscience Terminology working groups, and the OneGeology Technical working group.&lt;/p>
